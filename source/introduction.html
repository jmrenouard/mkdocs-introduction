      ##So what is this MkDocs?

      * MkDocs is a "static site generator"
      * Dynamic sites require a programming language, a webserver and a database
      * Static sites are just a bunch of HTML files that can run anywhere
      * MkDocs specializes on creating documentation websites
      * Content is generated via Markdown files.
      * Official website: [http://www.mkdocs.org](http://www.mkdocs.org)

      ##Ok, but I never heard about Markdown!

      * Markdown is a formatting syntax
      * It is also a text-to-HTML conversion tool
      * It is easy to read for humans *and* for machines
      * You write simple text files and convert them into complex HTML files
      * Official website: [http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)

      ##What do you mean by easy to read?

      Markdown turns this:

<pre><code># Headline

Some text...

* List item 1
* List item 2
</code></pre>
      Into this:

<pre><code>{% filter escape %}<h1>Headline</h1>

<p>Some text...</p>

<ul>
  <li>* List item 1</li>
  <li>* List item 2</li>
</ul>
{% endfilter %}
</code></pre>

      * You "put a folder under version control"
      * This folder is now a "Git repository"
      * Git can record all changes that you make
      * Now you can "go back in time" to older versions of your files
      * You can publish your code online
      * Others can collaborate and send "pull requests"
      * Official website: [http://www.git-scm.com](http://www.git-scm.com)
