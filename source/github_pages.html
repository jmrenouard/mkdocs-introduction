      ##GitHub Pages

      * We know: GitHub hosts the world's open source code
      * We also know: Every good software should have a good documentation
      * That means, all of GitHub's users have the same problem:
        * "where to host my documentation??"
        * If you wrote a really popular software, hosting documentation<br />
          can even be quite expensive
      * GitHub solves that problem with [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com)

      ##How does it work?

      * MkDocs makes it so easy, you don't even need to know how it works
      * But in case you are curious, it works like this:
        * if you create a branch called `gh-pages` in your repository
        * and if you put some static HTML files into that branch
        * then GitHub will see that and create an URL like this:
        * http://username.github.io/repo-name
    </script>

      ##How does MkDocs do it?

      * When you are done editing your content, simply run:

<pre><code>mkdocs gh-deploy</code></pre>

      * MkDocs will create a `gh-pages` branch
      * It will run `mkdocs build` and generate the `site` folder
      * It will copy the `site` folder into the `gh-pages` branch
      * It will run `git push origin:gh-pages`
        * That means: It pushes your local `gh-pages` branch into your<br />
          public repository on GitHub
      * GitHub will automatically notice that the `gh-pages` branch has changed
      * A few seconds later, your new content will be visible online
