<pre><code>mkdir -p ~/Projects/mkdocs-test
cd ~/Projects/mkdocs-test

      ##Official Documentation

      * As you can see it's all pretty simple
      * First you add some pages to `mkdocs.yml`
      * Then you create the files and write Markdown content
      * Finally you look at it with `mkdocs serve`
      * Learn more about [writing your docs](http://www.mkdocs.org/user-guide/writing-your-docs/)
      * Learn more about the [available configuration](http://www.mkdocs.org/user-guide/configuration/)
