      ## What is this SSH key?

      * SSH is an encrypted network protocol
      * It allows you to securely login to remote servers
      * For the encryption to work, you have to create a "key"
      * The key consists of a public and a private part
      * Both parts are files in your `~/.ssh/` folder
      * When you give your public key to GitHub, you can now<br />
        "SSH into" their server and upload your files
      * **NEVER** give away your private key.
      * If you lose your private key, you lose access to all servers<br />
        where you used it before (not so bad for GitHub, just make<br />
        a new keypair).
