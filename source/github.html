      ##Create your SSH key

      * On Windows, start git-bash
      * On OSX and Ubuntu just start the Terminal

<pre><code>ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your@email.com"
# Press enter several times
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
# Copy the output into the clipboard (CTRL+C)
</code></pre>

      * Go to https://github.com/settings/ssh
      * Click at "Add SSH key"
      * Paste your public key into the field and click "Add key"

      ## What is this SSH key?

      * SSH is an encrypted network protocol
      * It allows you to securely login to remote servers
      * For the encryption to work, you have to create a "key"
      * The key consists of a public and a private part
      * Both parts are files in your `~/.ssh/` folder
      * When you give your public key to GitHub, you can now<br />
        "SSH into" their server and upload your files
      * **NEVER** give away your private key.
      * If you lose your private key, you lose access to all servers<br />
        where you used it before (not so bad for GitHub, just make<br />
        a new keypair).

      ## Let's create a public repository (1/2)

      * You should still have the `git-test` repository we created earlier
      * Go to [https://github.com/new](https://github.com/new)
      * Name your new repository `git-test` & click at "Create repository"
      * You now have an empty public repository
      * GitHub shows you some hints on what to do next
      * Make sure to switch the button at the top from "HTTPS" to "SSH"
      * That way you don't have to enter your username and password when you
        push code because you are using your SSH-key to identify yourself
      * (continue reading on next slide)

      ## Let's create a public repository (2/2)

      * Look at the lower part of the instructions
      * This part is for existing repositories (you already have it on your PC)
      * Copy and paste the two commands into your command line

<pre><code># They look like this:
git remote add origin git@github.com:YOURUSERNAME/git-test.git
git push -u origin master
</code></pre>

      * Refresh your browser
      * The GitHub instructions will disappear
      * You will now see the code that you have just pushed

      ## Clone your repository (1/2)

      * Let's say your laptop explodes and you lose all your files (touch wood!)
      * to simulate this situation, delete the `git-test` folder on your computer

<pre><code>rm -rf ~/Projects/git-test</code></pre>

      * Now you have a new computer and you clone your repository from GitHub
      * Open your repository on GitHub in your browser
      * There is a little link at the bottom right:

      <img src="./img/clone.png" />

      ## Clone your repository (2/)

      * copy the SSH link from the GitHub page
      * and clone the repository into your computer:

<pre><code>cd ~/Projects
git clone git@github.com:YOURUSERNAME/git-test.git
cd git-test
ls
</code></pre>

      * You should see your files again :)
