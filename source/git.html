      ##Configure Git

      * You must tell git who you are so that it can write proper logs

git config --global user.name "Your Name"

      ##Create a repository

      * When you run `git init` in any folder, it will be turned into a
        git-repository.
<pre><code>mkdir -p ~/Projects/git-test
cd ~/Projects/git-test
git init
</code></pre>
      * Git creates a hidden folder `.git` in your folder
      * You can see it with `ls -force`

git status

      * `git status` will show you that there is one new untracked file
      * **Untracked** means, that this file is currently **not** under version control

      ##This is just the tip of the iceberg

      * The commands above are just minimal basics
      * Later you will learn about `branches` and `merging` and `forking` and
        `pulling` and `pushing`
      * We will probably do a workshop only for Git, soon.
