      ##Recap

      * High-five! You know pretty much everything about Markdown now
      * Use the [Markdown documentation](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) if you need to refresh your memory
      * You have installed Git - after your editor, probably the most essential tool<br />
        for any software developer on the planet
      * Unfortunately, Git is really complex. We will learn more about that, soon!
      * You have a SSH-key and a GitHub profile now,<br />
        you can now publish open source code and change the world!<br />
